A set of AI-enabled effects, generators, and analyzers for [Audacity¬Æ](https://www.audacityteam.org/). These AI features run 100% locally on your PC :computer: -- no internet connection necessary! [OpenVINO‚Ñ¢](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) is used to run AI models on supported accelerators found on the user's system such as CPU, GPU, and NPU.
